# The Problem
Pangenomes from genome assemblies can be befuddled by missassemblies of genes, expecially those truncated by contig breaks.

# The Solution
`annofilt` is used to filter annotations that appear to be truncated, based on a pangenome of closed genomes.  the algorithm proceeds as follows:


```
for gene in assembly:
   blast against pangenome database
   if the hit passes thresholds set by user:
     retain
   else:
     reject
```


# Building a reference pangenome of trusted genes
To verify the length of annotated genes, we compare annotation length, alignement coverage, and evalue to a pangenme built of well-currated annotations for a given strain.  To build a pangenome for your strain of interest, do the following:
1: Download as many complete genomes (in gff format) from RefSeq as desired (minimum of 10?, maybe?)
2: Run Roary.  This is a good time to explore their stringincy options for percentage identity (which defaults to 95%)
3: Move the `pan_genome_reference.fa` file to a convenient location for use with annofilt.  This contains a representative nucleotide sequences for each gene in the core.

# Running
`annofilt` has three modes:
1 *Normal* (fastest) - check annotations at the beginning and end of contigs
2 *Local-quick* (medium) - use Prokka's protein multifasta  of all genes when blasting; saves the step of writing the genes to disk, but jobs cant be distributed
3. *Full* (slowest) - genes are blasted individually; this gives more control with job hanndling (future versions will hopefully work with SGE, slurm, etc.)

# Quick Start

(Test data can be downloaded here)[https://zenodo.org/record/1196324/files/annofilt_test_data_archive.tar.gz]

The test data contains a pangenome of 11 *E. coli* genomes, as well as a complete genome annotated with Prokka, and a toy genome assembly also annotated with Prokka.  To run `annofilt` with the test data, run the following command:

```
annofilt annofilt_test_data_archive/11complete_colis/pan_genome_reference.fa ./annofilt_test_data_archive/assembly_sample/ -o out -v 1
```
